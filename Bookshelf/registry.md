### Objective

This book registry was created so that I can remember I have those books and I should find time to study them soon.

## Machine Learning Skill

### 1. Monetizing Machine Learning (Apress) (Priority 1)

    This book teaches how to develop a machine learning model that suitable for customers' need and can go to the market as soon as possible.
    
    This should be a good book for learning ML and building a web app (using Flask and other technologies) at the same time.
    
    
### 2. Introduction to Machine Learning with Python (O'reilly) (Priority 1)

    This book focuses on scikit-learn.
    
    It should be a good starting point for studying ML with Python.
    
    
### 3. Programming Machine Learning (Pragmetic Bookshelf) (Priority 2)

    This is a book for learning ML from scratch.
    
    It is good to get a deeper understanding of how to implement ML algorithms just to gain a better understanding.


### 4. Thoughtful Machine Learning with Python (O'Reilly) (Priority 2)

    This book teaches how to develop a ML model in production.
    
    It should be good to read after having a working background in ML.
    
    
### 5. Python Machine Learning by Examples (Packtpub) (Priotiry 2)

    This book provides various examples of applying ML to real-world problems.
    
    It seems like a good book to study to hone data-solving skill.


### 6. Practical Data Science with Python 3 (Apress) (Priority 2)

    This book combines data science with data engineering to solve real-world problems.
